	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<h3>2.1</h3>
	<p>Our customer is requesting a sonic visualizer using virtual reality. As for specifics, the customer gave us creative freedom on what we wanted to create, so long as it worked under the guidelines he requested. Our team decideded on developing a virtual reality “game” with implementation of sonic user handling. After further discussion with our customer, we determined Unity3D was the best option for us to create our game. With little to no user experience using Unity3D, our first goal was to get familiar with the software and begin to figure out basic implementations of VR. Once these implementations are in place, we want to export our program to both Android and iOS devices. From there we can get a basic virtual reality demo in place. For time constraints, our goal is to get that implemented as quick as possible.</p>
	<p>Once this is implemented, our next goal is to create a sonic visualization. We want to create a way for the game environment to interact with outsource sounds. A basic idea is to have blocks stretch up and down the y-axis based on sound volumes, sort of like a stereo. Once this is completed and we have a basic understanding of how to visualize audio input, we will transfer over to using microphone and having audio sensory working in real time. Since we are wanting to create an objective based game, we wanted the audio to be used as user handling tools for the game. An example would be, when the user claps their hands, the game will register the clap and complete the command associated to that sound. 
Once this is completed, the team will combine the virtual reality with the audio implementation and export it to both Android and iOS devices.</p> 
	<p>Our next goal is to create a game layout. Our idea is to create a basic arcade game style game  where the user keeps going until they request to quit, or until a “player dies” scenario. The game will have multiple scenes in the hierarchy. When opening up the app, the user will be introduced to the home screen, these options include a play function, tutorial function and option function. The tutorial button will take you to a basic description and visualization of how the game should operate. The option menu should have some basic game functionality adjustments.</p>
<p>From here, there should be a basic game design layout with the applied audio component to the game with user testing. We hope our final product will have a functioning game that uses audio handling mechanism. The game should have a clean UI and overall easy to understanda user experience. 
</p>
	<h3>2.2</h3>
	<p> Unity3D provides a substantial amount UI tools and functionality. This helps narrow down coding that would of taken unnecessary amount of time. For certain functionality of our game, we plan to have C# sharp scripts throughout our game for different functionality. The team has estimated no more than 500 lines of code for this project. We are estimating our length based off of scene design. Unity3D gives us the ability to create multiple scenes within our game. We believe we’ll need 4 scenes. 3 scenes will be UI experience; start menu, pause menu, end menu. The 4th scene will be the game itself. The game description will be found in our design consideration tab. </p>
	<h3>2.3</h3>
	<p> <a href="./calendar.html">Calendar</a> </p>
	<h3>2.4</h3>
	<p> The main component we are using to contract our VR game is Unity 3D. This is free to use 3D game engine, commonly utilized within the game development industry. Underneath Unity 3D, we are using C# scripts to execute what we want done in program. One the advantages of this includes the cast array of documentation and plug-ins available for this program. 3D assets for the game will be either free-to-use assets in the Unity Store or created in Blender.</p>
	<p> One of these plug-ins is for the use of Google Cardboard. This API allows us to easily convert our Unity project into a usable Android and iOS app. This gives us potential for rapid prototyping and testing if our game. We are using Google Cardboard V0.6, as newer versions are built more towards Google Daydream. This would limit our potential devices to just newer Android phones.</p>
