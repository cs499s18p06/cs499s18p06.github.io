	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>Our team is developing a virtual reality “game” with implementation of sonic user handling. After discussion with our customer, we determined Unity3D was the best option for us to create our game. With little to no user experience using Unity3D, our first goal was to get familiar with the software and begin to figure out basic implementations of VR. Once these implementations are in place, we want to export our program to both Android and iOS devices. From there we can get a basic virtual reality demo in place. For time constraints, our goal is to get that implemented as quick as possible.
Once this is implemented, our next goal is to create a sonic visualization. We want to create a way for the game environment to interact with outsource sounds. A basic idea is to have blocks stretch up and down the y-axis based on sound volumes, sort of like a stereo. Once this is completed and we have a basic understanding of how to visualize audio input, we will transfer over to using microphone and having audio sensory working in real time. Since we are wanting to create an objective based game, we wanted the audio to be used as user handling tools for the game. An example would be, when the user claps their hands, the game will register the clap and complete the command associated to that sound. 
Once this is completed, the team will combine the virtual reality with the audio implementation and export it to both Android and iOS devices. 
Our next goal is to create a game layout. Our idea is to create a basic arcade game style game  where the user keeps going until they request to quit, or until a “player dies” scenario. The game will have multiple scenes in the hierarchy. When opening up the app, the user will be introduced to the home screen, these options include a play function, tutorial function and option function. The tutorial button will take you to a basic description and visualization of how the game should operate.
From here, there should be a basic game design layout with the applied audio component to the game with user testing. We hope our final product will have a functioning game that uses audio handling mechanism. The game should have a clean UI and overall easy to understandable user experience.
