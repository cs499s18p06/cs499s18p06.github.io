	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>	Virtual reality (VR) is an artificial environment produced by computers that allows a person to interact through gestures and sounds. Traditionally, VR has primarily focused on using user’s visual capability to interact with the perceived environment, but our project will explore the implementation of an additional sense: sound.
		<br/><br/>
		We will be using Unity3D to design an app for Android and iOS mobile devices that will allow the user to play a simple virtual reality game through the use of their mobile device and a VR headset. The game will be played using both traditional VR motions, such as looking at a single location to select items on a menu, as well as incorporate a microphone component to change what the user sees. The microphone component will be a major part of gameplay because it will determine what sound the user is producing based on key criteria such as frequency analysis, beat detection, and amplitude envelope (a.k.a. pitch, rhythm, and volume), then it will change the visual scene of the game in a meaningful way. If a sound has a higher pitch than another sound, then the visual scene will change in different ways that are important to what happens in the game.
		<br/><br/>
		The customer is Bob Henz, an avid hobbyist of VR visualizer technology and the target users are people of all ages who enjoy games. We plan to capture all age groups through simplistic yet entertaining gameplay.
