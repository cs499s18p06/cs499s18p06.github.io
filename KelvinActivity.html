	<h3>Week 10: April 15, 2018</h3>
	<p>Since last week, there hasn't been a lot more for me to implement in my part of the project. To add some professional looking flare to the game, I added some particle effects that give the world a bit of life. These effects look like dust particles which spawn in, move slightly, then despawn. In the future, they can be manipulated to also pulse with the sound or change colors/shapes. I also realized that the directional light in the world was set to a daylight color, giving the world a very unnatural look. Being that it is night time and a cemetary layout, the world should be darker, so I changed the directional light's color to a darker blue to give that feel of night time. This also helps the particles stand out more and give a greater effect. We are now almost finished with the project, and this next week is going to be focused on completely finishing everything that still needs to be done. </p>

	<h3>Week 9: April 8, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week was a very productive week for me. I was able to get a lot of work done on the scripts that were necessary for the Fast Fourier Transformation on each object in the world, as well as a script to light up the skybox with the bass frequency. To light up the skybox with the bass, I wrote a script called SkyBoxColors, which uses a similar mechanic to the Bounce script, except instead of transforming the scale fo the object, it changes the exposure of the skybox. This turns the sky from a dark blue to a slightly lighter blue as if there was a lightning flash in the background. 

	As well as lighting up the skybox, I created scripts for the movement of the ghost enemies. I created two scripts, GhostCircular and GhostLinear, which allow the ghost to move in pretty much any direction. GhostCircular is a script which makes the ghost move in a circular/ovular pattern, and the ghost can pop out of the ground while moving. In the GhostLinear script, the ghost slides back and forth between two points, and it can move in any direction by changing the X, Y, or Z values. 

	The final addition I made this week was creating models for the minecart and the track. These models were created in blender, and I made a straight track, a 90 degree curved track, and a 45 degree curved track. The minecart was a simple placeholder box with a hole cut into it for the player to sit in. Caitlin did an excellent job of laying out the track in the world, and we are just waiting on Kyle to implement the movement of the character and the minecart before we have a working prototype. </p>

	<h3>Week 8: April 1, 2018</h3>
	<p>I was incredibly sick this past week, so I have been unable to focus on the project very much, but I know what I have left to do. I have to prepare my files to be implemented with the rest of the group's parts,
	and then work with the group to finalize everything together. There are a couple models that I still need to make, then everything should be ready to go.</p>

	<h3>Week 7: March 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week was our first meeting with our customer since the beginning of the semester, and we were able to clarify details of the project which were necessary before continuing any further. I brought up the issue of
	having to choose between either Clap to Shoot, or having the environment react to the sound frequencies. Those two options are mutually exclusive because it is incredibly hard to differentiate claps from other sound inputs, 
	meaning that the shooting would be very inconsistent, and the environment would also be reacting to claps as well as other input, resulting in a jittery and unattractive scenario overall. Our customer decided that he would
	rather have the environment reacting to the frequencies, so the clap input is now voided from the project. </p>
	<p>So far, everything should work with the current scripts that I have created to have objects react to the frequency bands, though some objects may need slight adjustments to obtain different effects from the sounds. We are
	also exploring ideas for other ways that the environment can react to the frequencies, and I will immediately get to work on implementing those as soon as ideas are shared. Until then, I will continue to sharpen up the current
	scripts and continue to model the assets that Caitlin requires for the world design.</p>

	<h3>Weeks 5/6: March 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>Over Spring Break, I did not have a lot of time to work on the project, but I did manage to get a few things done in the past two weeks. I sorted out the problems that I had with modeling the ghost enemy in Blender, and was able to implement that into Unity3d. </p>
	<p>I also managed to finally take in a clap as input for the shooting mechanic in our game. To do this, I used the same system of audio management that I've been messing with throughout this project (FFT, or Fast Fourier Transform). The initial use of FFT for me was to split the microphone input into 8 different frequency bands, creating an equalizer sort of effect. To read in a clap, though, it is hard to pin point exactly which band is the most used since claps are not perfectly consistent among different people or even just from one person. So instead of trying to find which band is the best to read claps from, I took the max value out of all of the bands, set a threshold for the quietest a clap can be, then any sound higher than that threshold counts as a clap. This works well to find claps as input, but another part of our project is having everything bounce/pulse along with the music or input, and I am not sure if this will work at the same time as taking claps as input. I also don't know if I need to use FFT to read the claps, or if I can do it a simpler way. In the next week I hope to know for sure whether or not I can take claps and have music at the same time, and I will see if there is a better way to take the claps for input. </p>
	
	<h3>Week 4: March 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>At the start of this week, I was mainly focused on the level design of our first level, setting up the graveyard for the ghosts/ghouls to pop out of to be shot. I quickly learned that I am not the best at level design, and after discussing with the group, the job was passed on to Caitlin, who is much better suited for the job. From there, I kept working on the models of the actual enemies that will pop up, and I am still working on taking claps for input. I believe that there might be a simpler way to do it than using the Fast Fourier Transform method, but I have not seen it in action yet. This week I'll keep finishing up the enemy models while still working on the clap inputs, hopefully having that done very soon.</p>

	<h3>Week 3: February 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week, there was not a lot of work to be done. The main issue we tackled was the presentation, making sure that all of the slides were laid out perfectly and everybody has their part ready to go. As well as working on the power point, I began laying out the world using the model packs that we decided on. Instead of creating every model from scratch, we are going to use packs that are free on the Unity Asset Store, both because they are simple to use and they are just better assets in general. By next week I hope to either have the world ready to move models around in or be able to take a clap as input for the shooting mechanic. </p>

	
	<h3>Week 2: February 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>Before our team meeting this week, I was still unable to find much to work to do to help with the project. To add to my current visualization testing, I have made it so that
	the models, or each individual piece of a model, can change color based on the frequency of the sound input. This can also work with the brightness or alpha of the colors,
	opening a wide variety of options to work with in the future.</p>
	<p>Once we met and discussed the project again, this time in more depth on what exactly we are doing, we were able to decide what I need to work on. I have begun modeling the
	assets that we will be using for the project. So far, I have made the cart for the player to ride in, and pieces of the track for the cart to ride on. I have also been messing 
	around with the type of enemy models we will be using, whether it will look like a cardboard cutout or an actual 3d model that can move in any axis. Due to the time constraints
	of this project, and how long it takes to animate models, I believe that cardboard cutout enemies will be the best way to get a quick start on the project, and if there is extra 
	time at the end I can make more detailed 3d models. I also need to start creating more environment models, like clouds, trees, flowers, grass, etc. which I will be starting on
	in the next week. </p>


	<h3>Week 1: February 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week was a sort of introductory week to the Unity3D engine, which we'll be using for the rest of this project. I spent most of my time learning to capture microphone input,
	which I then was able to visualize in a series of bars that scale with the frequencies of the sound input. Then, as a proof of concept, I modeled a couple flowers and made the 
	flower petals scale in the same fashion. This coming week I'll be making sure that I can export the game to my iPhone from my mac, hopefully without too many issues. I'd like to 
	set up a basic landscape with more models that scale with the sound input, but we have still yet to decide on what final product we would like. Once we figure that out, I will
	immediately start working on getting the audio-visualization working with it. Other than that, there is not much for me to work on yet at this stage of the project.</p>
