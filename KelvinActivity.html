	<h3>Weeks 5/6: March 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>Over Spring Break, I did not have a lot of time to work on the project, but I did manage to get a few things done in the past two weeks. I sorted out the problems that I had with modeling the ghost enemy in Blender, and was able to implement that into Unity3d. </p>
	<p>I also managed to finally take in a clap as input for the shooting mechanic in our game. To do this, I used the same system of audio management that I've been messing with throughout this project (FFT, or Fast Fourier Transform). The initial use of FFT for me was to split the microphone input into 8 different frequency bands, creating an equalizer sort of effect. To read in a clap, though, it is hard to pin point exactly which band is the most used since claps are not perfectly consistent among different people or even just from one person. So instead of trying to find which band is the best to read claps from, I took the max value out of all of the bands, set a threshold for the quietest a clap can be, then any sound higher than that threshold counts as a clap. This works well to find claps as input, but another part of our project is having everything bounce/pulse along with the music or input, and I am not sure if this will work at the same time as taking claps as input. I also don't know if I need to use FFT to read the claps, or if I can do it a simpler way. In the next week I hope to know for sure whether or not I can take claps and have music at the same time, and I will see if there is a better way to take the claps for input. </p>
	
	<h3>Week 4: March 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>At the start of this week, I was mainly focused on the level design of our first level, setting up the graveyard for the ghosts/ghouls to pop out of to be shot. I quickly learned that I am not the best at level design, and after discussing with the group, the job was passed on to Caitlin, who is much better suited for the job. From there, I kept working on the models of the actual enemies that will pop up, and I am still working on taking claps for input. I believe that there might be a simpler way to do it than using the Fast Fourier Transform method, but I have not seen it in action yet. This week I'll keep finishing up the enemy models while still working on the clap inputs, hopefully having that done very soon.</p>

	<h3>Week 3: February 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week, there was not a lot of work to be done. The main issue we tackled was the presentation, making sure that all of the slides were laid out perfectly and everybody has their part ready to go. As well as working on the power point, I began laying out the world using the model packs that we decided on. Instead of creating every model from scratch, we are going to use packs that are free on the Unity Asset Store, both because they are simple to use and they are just better assets in general. By next week I hope to either have the world ready to move models around in or be able to take a clap as input for the shooting mechanic. </p>

	
	<h3>Week 2: February 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>Before our team meeting this week, I was still unable to find much to work to do to help with the project. To add to my current visualization testing, I have made it so that
	the models, or each individual piece of a model, can change color based on the frequency of the sound input. This can also work with the brightness or alpha of the colors,
	opening a wide variety of options to work with in the future.</p>
	<p>Once we met and discussed the project again, this time in more depth on what exactly we are doing, we were able to decide what I need to work on. I have begun modeling the
	assets that we will be using for the project. So far, I have made the cart for the player to ride in, and pieces of the track for the cart to ride on. I have also been messing 
	around with the type of enemy models we will be using, whether it will look like a cardboard cutout or an actual 3d model that can move in any axis. Due to the time constraints
	of this project, and how long it takes to animate models, I believe that cardboard cutout enemies will be the best way to get a quick start on the project, and if there is extra 
	time at the end I can make more detailed 3d models. I also need to start creating more environment models, like clouds, trees, flowers, grass, etc. which I will be starting on
	in the next week. </p>


	<h3>Week 1: February 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week was a sort of introductory week to the Unity3D engine, which we'll be using for the rest of this project. I spent most of my time learning to capture microphone input,
	which I then was able to visualize in a series of bars that scale with the frequencies of the sound input. Then, as a proof of concept, I modeled a couple flowers and made the 
	flower petals scale in the same fashion. This coming week I'll be making sure that I can export the game to my iPhone from my mac, hopefully without too many issues. I'd like to 
	set up a basic landscape with more models that scale with the sound input, but we have still yet to decide on what final product we would like. Once we figure that out, I will
	immediately start working on getting the audio-visualization working with it. Other than that, there is not much for me to work on yet at this stage of the project.</p>
