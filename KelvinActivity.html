	<h3>Week 1: February 7, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week was a sort of introductory week to the Unity3D engine, which we'll be using for the rest of this project. I spent most of my time learning to capture microphone input,
	which I then was able to visualize in a series of bars that scale with the frequencies of the sound input. Then, as a proof of concept, I modeled a couple flowers and made the 
	flower petals scale in the same fashion. This coming week I'll be making sure that I can export the game to my iPhone from my mac, hopefully without too many issues. I'd like to 
	set up a basic landscape with more models that scale with the sound input, but we have still yet to decide on what final product we would like. Once we figure that out, I will
	immediately start working on getting the audio-visualization working with it. Other than that, there is not much for me to work on yet at this stage of the project.</p>
