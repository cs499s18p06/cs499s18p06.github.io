	<h3>Week 3: February 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week, there was not a lot of work to be done. The main issue we tackled was the presentation, making sure that all of the slides were laid out perfectly and everybody has their part ready to go. As well as working on the power point, I began laying out the world using the model packs that we decided on. Instead of creating every model from scratch, we are going to use packs that are free on the Unity Asset Store, both because they are simple to use and they are just better assets in general. By next week I hope to either have the world ready to move models around in or be able to take a clap as input for the shooting mechanic. </p>

	
	<h3>Week 2: February 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>Before our team meeting this week, I was still unable to find much to work to do to help with the project. To add to my current visualization testing, I have made it so that
	the models, or each individual piece of a model, can change color based on the frequency of the sound input. This can also work with the brightness or alpha of the colors,
	opening a wide variety of options to work with in the future.</p>
	<p>Once we met and discussed the project again, this time in more depth on what exactly we are doing, we were able to decide what I need to work on. I have begun modeling the
	assets that we will be using for the project. So far, I have made the cart for the player to ride in, and pieces of the track for the cart to ride on. I have also been messing 
	around with the type of enemy models we will be using, whether it will look like a cardboard cutout or an actual 3d model that can move in any axis. Due to the time constraints
	of this project, and how long it takes to animate models, I believe that cardboard cutout enemies will be the best way to get a quick start on the project, and if there is extra 
	time at the end I can make more detailed 3d models. I also need to start creating more environment models, like clouds, trees, flowers, grass, etc. which I will be starting on
	in the next week. </p>


	<h3>Week 1: February 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week was a sort of introductory week to the Unity3D engine, which we'll be using for the rest of this project. I spent most of my time learning to capture microphone input,
	which I then was able to visualize in a series of bars that scale with the frequencies of the sound input. Then, as a proof of concept, I modeled a couple flowers and made the 
	flower petals scale in the same fashion. This coming week I'll be making sure that I can export the game to my iPhone from my mac, hopefully without too many issues. I'd like to 
	set up a basic landscape with more models that scale with the sound input, but we have still yet to decide on what final product we would like. Once we figure that out, I will
	immediately start working on getting the audio-visualization working with it. Other than that, there is not much for me to work on yet at this stage of the project.</p>
