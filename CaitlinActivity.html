	<h3>Week 8: April 1, 2018</h3>
	<p>Earlier this week I completed the terrain. The terrain has all of the tombstones and cemetery features placed, and placeholder objects for trees and the funeral home. When the models for those are complete I should be able to replace the tree placeholders with the prefab models Kelvin develops. I’ve put the terrain I developed on our google drive account so that the others can download it and make their changes. They will be developing prefabs for everything they are doing so it will be easy to compile everything. I also put it in the GitHub repository, that way everyone can access it and perhaps version control will be better.</p>
	<p>I worked on the <a href="./Testing.html">Test Plan</a> and Clayton helped fine tune a few things in the Unit Testing section. I spent a large amount of time working on webpage maintenance this week. I had to figure out how to format the multi-level bulleted lists on the <a href="./Testing.html">Testing</a> page as well as figure out how to make the table on that page. Thankfully, I could pull experience from the <a href="./User_Scenarios.html">User Scenarios</a> page since it also has bullet points, although they aren’t multi-level. Having to code every HTML page by hand can get pretty taxing when you have a lot of work to do, but thankfully I wasn’t on a time crunch when learning about the tags.</p>
	
	<h3>Week 7: March 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>I spent this week working on the terrain and perfecting the minutiae. Creating lakes and streams has been a particular challenge because I previously had a terrain I was working on, but then I tried to lower the terrain to create a lake, but that wouldn’t work because the terrain was already at the lowest point it could be. I started a new terrain and used the Paint Height tool, since I couldn’t make sense of some of the tutorials on how to programmably raise the terrain, to make the entire terrain a certain height. I then started edging the terrain with mountains and hills. The center of the terrain is a rolling hill type landscape with a few water features thrown in. The track has its own raised rail bed that is contoured to each rolling hill. I feel that I could’ve made the track’s course better, but I can always change it if I get to do future levels. The track starts at the mouth of the valley and curves across it before exiting through a mountain passage. I want the mountain passage to look like the entrance to a mine, but I can’t make a tunnel through the terrain with the tools Unity provides. I will attempt to make it look like a tunnel without actually making one. When the user goes through it, it will activate a load screen to end the level and either end the game or continue to the next level if there is one. At this time, I don’t have the terrain completed, but I have high hopes that it will proceed quickly now that I have the hard part done.</p>

	<h3>Weeks 5/6: March 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>During midterm week I did not work on the project at all until Friday. Our weekly team meeting was held over a Google Hangout, which we have gotten to work in the past, but for reasons unknown, would not work for me this time. I eventually gave up trying to figure out what went wrong and Clayton and Kelvin held the rest of the meeting without me. We had some feedback on our website that we needed to address, so the guys worked on that during the meeting time. I later worked on incorporating the developed materials into the website. I had to update the CSS file to include formatting for the bullet points on the <a href="./User_Scenarios.html">User Scenarios</a> page. I had no clue that there were so many different ways to format bullet points, but after 30 minutes of researching HTML tags and what those tags would look like, I found one I was confident would look professional and suit our data.</p>
	<p>During Spring Break, I tried to work on getting the terrain looking the way I wanted, but after several hours of tweaking the terrain, I went to save the project and it would not save on my computer. In fact, Unity 3D itself crashed. I had been working through a remote desktop session at the time, so when I got back to my physical desktop I started investigating. It turns out I had some memory issues which prevented Unity 3D from making and saving proper temporary files. After all that time and work lost, I decided to put it away and come back to it later. Thankfully, some of the design choices I made the first time around should be easier to implement the next time.</p>

	<h3>Week 4: March 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>With impending midterms, this week was largely unproductive. I searched for more specific tutorials for Unity 3D to implement the rail track and cart, but I couldn’t find quality tutorials. Most of the videos I encountered were advertisements for expensive asset packages, or product display videos that were mislabeled as tutorials. Thankfully, Kyle was working on the same problem and was able to find an asset package that was not only free but he believes will work for our purposes.</p>
	<p>The main part of the rail track and cart mechanism is making the cart follow a specific path (visually represented by the rail track) and having the camera follow the cart to give the first-person point of view. From my research, there are two general methods of approaching this type of problem. The first method involves using splines to create the curves in the track and attaching a cart to follow the spline. There were several videos I watched about this and it seemed fairly easy to implement, but the asset package used in those videos is outside the budget of this project (a.k.a more than $0). I then turned to the other method: using waypoints. While I haven’t dug into Kyle’s asset package yet, it appears waypoints are the method it uses.</p>
	<p>During the team meeting this week, we discussed the <a href ="./Design.html">Design</a> page of the website. Since we use Google Drive to store our meeting notes and other group documents, we were all working on the same document to create the language for the <a href ="./Design.html">Design</a> page. I revised the Overview section, while the guys worked on the other two sections (Environment and Module Descriptions). After they were done, I copied all the text and images and imported it to the webpage. Clayton made the Module Description diagram, but after some suggestions from the group about color choices, he decided to remake it to improve clarity. I told him that since I already had the html document set up, he would only have to replace the image and make sure the images were named the same. There were some hiccups, but we got them resolved and the new diagram looks professionally done.</p>
	<p>During the next two weeks, I will start taking Kelvin’s object models (tomb stones, rails, buildings, etc.) and start creating the terrain. I will start with a basic low-poly forested mountain range and create a cemetery on one side, then we can build from there. I’m looking forward to working on the terrain that will most likely appear in our final game release.</p>

	<h3>Week 3 Supplemental</h3>
	<p>There was an encoding issue with Kelvin's weekly update. After he pushed it to github, the page refused to load. In order to fix this issue I had to copy the text in his html file, delete the file, and create a new file with a different encoding scheme. To date, Kelvin's weekly activity page is the only one to have this issue. I will keep watch over the other pages in case this occurs in the future.</p>

	<h3>Week 3: February 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week I followed a tutorial (<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3LYJINnYtE">Camera on Rail</a>) that ended up not being very helpful. I did learn some important lessons about how to make game objects and attach C# scripts to them. I thought it was going to be written in the code where to attach the C# script to the game object, but apparently, it’s just a drag-and-drop motion in the Inspector section of the menu. The reason the tutorial wasn’t helpful to me is because I couldn’t replicate the type of motion in the video in my own project. I’m not sure if it is because I didn’t place the reference sphere’s correctly, I messed up part of the C# script, or if it is a compatibility issue with the Unity version in the video and the Unity version I’m using (2017). I’m going to look up more tutorials about how to make a first-person game and how to automate the movement of a cart on a rail type system next week. Considering these are the main automated movements of our game, it’s important to find quality resources to learn from so that we can replicate the movement and be able to modify it to our purpose.</p>
	<p>I started creating the designs for each level of the game. We decided to start with one level and, time pending, make more levels of increasing difficulty that the player can gain ‘points’ for defeating the monsters. One such level design included shooting ghosts. The player would shoot ghosts from a cart, accumulate points, and advance through different scenery along the way until the end of the level. For instance, the level would start in a funeral home, proceed through a cemetery, then move on to other places that would stereotypically inhabit ghosts (decrepit homes, abandoned mine tunnels, etc.). At the end of each level, the player swaps out their weapon to fight the next type of monster. In order to fight ghosts, the player needs ectoplasm guns, a werewolf is defeated with a wooden stake gun, etc. Each different type of monster will be a different level and each level will contain terrain that is typical of the monster being fought. These designs and mechanics will be further refined at a later date.	</p>

	<h3>Week 2: February 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week came with a lot of studying, but not much work on the actual project. I created my ‘Hello World’ program in Unity3D, which allowed me to make sure my Unity installation was installed correctly and gave me a brief tutorial into C# programming. After completing my ‘Hello World’ program, I tinkered with the terrains and developed a rocky looking mountain. I learned how to use the six tools for manipulating the terrain. The first three tools were fairly intuitive to learn, but the last three required some research since I didn’t have any experience with image editing tools. I followed several tutorials to learn how to use the ‘Paint Texture’ tool, which taught me that you can scale a texture to blend it better across the entire terrain. I had fun painting on several layers of texture and blending them in order to make a rocky mountain range, but then I decided I needed trees and grass to decorate my mountains.</p>
	<p>Learning how to add trees was interesting. I watched a tutorial that was difficult to follow because it was done on an older version of Unity3D and some of the features looked different or were in different places, but I was able to get the gist of what to do. I later found a more recent tutorial that explained things better and discovered many little intricacies to making terrains.</p>
	<p>During the group’s weekly Friday meeting, we discussed the components of the website that had pending due dates over the weekend. We came up with a timeline of project goals that I added to our <a href="./calendar.html">calendar</a>.</p>

	<h3>Week 1: February 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week I installed Unity3D on my computer. I haven’t gotten to do my ‘Hello World’ program, that the customer suggested, due to concentrating my efforts on getting the team’s website and other resources set up. To start with, I designed and coded, using HTML, 16 separate webpages. Every webpage has the same universal menu bar spanning the left side of the page. The menu bar consists of a small version of the logo and a link to every web page for this project. In reality, I got one page to be visually pleasing, then I copied the code into the other pages. This worked fairly well, but the downside was that any time I noticed a problem or decided to change the menu in any way, I would have to go through and make that change in each file.</p>
	<p>One change in particular presented a challenge: I decided to implement a small graphic to the page. When the user clicks on the ‘Team Members’ heading, a dropdown menu list of all the team member’s names will appear below the ‘Team Members’ heading. Each name is a link to the individual team member’s weekly activity page, but in order for the graphic to function, I had to include a small amount of JavaScript. While the online resources for both HTML and JavaScript were extremely helpful and easy to follow, I did have issues understanding the CSS required. I eventually played with some sample code enough to learn what was necessary to truly bring an artistic flair to the website.</p>
	<p>The second thing I did was create a gmail account for the group. The email address is VRMIC499@gmail.com. The group agreed that it would be for the best to create a group email address to communicate with our customer through as well as to sign us up for GitHub and any other resources we might need of similar nature. That way everyone has equal access and ability to see all correspondence at any time they chose. I used this email address to register our group with GitHub, then I spent several hours trying to figure out how to host our website on GitHub Pages. Some of the issues I faced were directly related to the computer I was using and other issues were related to the documentation I found for setting up the GitHub repository and importing the HTML documents that were previously generated. I discovered that there were several different methods that the official documentation for GitHub had for interacting with the repositories, so I tried using the program for Windows, but that only works for 64-bit machines. My travel laptop is only 32-bits, so I tried using the terminal instructions instead, but I encountered some error messages that I didn’t know how to resolve immediately, so I avoided the whole situation by using another computer altogether (a 64-bit computer).</p>
	<p>The team decided to have a meeting on Friday to talk more in-depth about what Bob (the customer) had told us during our initial meeting with him and to share our experiences with the Unity3D ‘Hello World’ program. I didn’t have much to share in the way of code, but I did display the website and lead a discussion about the pending components of the website that were due that day (components 1.1 and 2.1). After our meeting, Clayton and I came up with some documentation to help the others install the desktop app for GitHub on their machines so that they could contribute to their weekly activity pages.</p>
	<p>The third thing I did this week was to type up the Introduction webpage that we discussed during the meeting and get the link to the webpage sent to Paul (the professor) in an email. I carbon copied everyone in the group on the email and sent it from the group email address so that there wouldn’t be any dispute on the subject in any way. Paul sent back an email affirming that he had read the pages and found a typo in the Introduction. I got the type fixed and emailed him back a thank you for finding it. The last thing I did this week was to write my own weekly activity post and to make sure that all my group members were able to post theirs to GitHub without any problems.</p>
