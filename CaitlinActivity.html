	<h3>Week 2: February 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week came with a lot of studying, but not much work on the actual project. I created my ‘Hello World’ program in Unity3D, which allowed me to make sure my Unity installation was installed correctly and gave me a brief tutorial into C# programming. After completing my ‘Hello World’ program, I tinkered with the terrains and developed a rocky looking mountain. I learned how to use the six tools for manipulating the terrain. The first three tools were fairly intuitive to learn, but the last three required some research since I didn’t have any experience with image editing tools. I followed several tutorials to learn how to use the ‘Paint Texture’ tool, which taught me that you can scale a texture to blend it better across the entire terrain. I had fun painting on several layers of texture and blending them in order to make a rocky mountain range, but then I decided I needed trees and grass to decorate my mountains.</p>
	<p>Learning how to add trees was interesting. I watched a tutorial that was difficult to follow because it was done on an older version of Unity3D and some of the features looked different or were in different places, but I was able to get the gist of what to do. I later found a more recent tutorial that explained things better and discovered many little intricacies to making terrains.</p>
	<p>During the group’s weekly Friday meeting, we discussed the components of the website that had pending due dates over the weekend. We came up with a timeline of project goals that I added to our <a href="./calendar.html">calendar</a>.</p>
	<h3>Week 1: February 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>This week I installed Unity3D on my computer. I haven’t gotten to do my ‘Hello World’ program, that the customer suggested, due to concentrating my efforts on getting the team’s website and other resources set up. To start with, I designed and coded, using HTML, 16 separate webpages. Every webpage has the same universal menu bar spanning the left side of the page. The menu bar consists of a small version of the logo and a link to every web page for this project. In reality, I got one page to be visually pleasing, then I copied the code into the other pages. This worked fairly well, but the downside was that any time I noticed a problem or decided to change the menu in any way, I would have to go through and make that change in each file.</p>
	<p>One change in particular presented a challenge: I decided to implement a small graphic to the page. When the user clicks on the ‘Team Members’ heading, a dropdown menu list of all the team member’s names will appear below the ‘Team Members’ heading. Each name is a link to the individual team member’s weekly activity page, but in order for the graphic to function, I had to include a small amount of JavaScript. While the online resources for both HTML and JavaScript were extremely helpful and easy to follow, I did have issues understanding the CSS required. I eventually played with some sample code enough to learn what was necessary to truly bring an artistic flair to the website.</p>
	<p>The second thing I did was create a gmail account for the group. The email address is VRMIC499@gmail.com. The group agreed that it would be for the best to create a group email address to communicate with our customer through as well as to sign us up for GitHub and any other resources we might need of similar nature. That way everyone has equal access and ability to see all correspondence at any time they chose. I used this email address to register our group with GitHub, then I spent several hours trying to figure out how to host our website on GitHub Pages. Some of the issues I faced were directly related to the computer I was using and other issues were related to the documentation I found for setting up the GitHub repository and importing the HTML documents that were previously generated. I discovered that there were several different methods that the official documentation for GitHub had for interacting with the repositories, so I tried using the program for Windows, but that only works for 64-bit machines. My travel laptop is only 32-bits, so I tried using the terminal instructions instead, but I encountered some error messages that I didn’t know how to resolve immediately, so I avoided the whole situation by using another computer altogether (a 64-bit computer).</p>
	<p>The team decided to have a meeting on Friday to talk more in-depth about what Bob (the customer) had told us during our initial meeting with him and to share our experiences with the Unity3D ‘Hello World’ program. I didn’t have much to share in the way of code, but I did display the website and lead a discussion about the pending components of the website that were due that day (components 1.1 and 2.1). After our meeting, Clayton and I came up with some documentation to help the others install the desktop app for GitHub on their machines so that they could contribute to their weekly activity pages.</p>
	<p>The third thing I did this week was to type up the Introduction webpage that we discussed during the meeting and get the link to the webpage sent to Paul (the professor) in an email. I carbon copied everyone in the group on the email and sent it from the group email address so that there wouldn’t be any dispute on the subject in any way. Paul sent back an email affirming that he had read the pages and found a typo in the Introduction. I got the type fixed and emailed him back a thank you for finding it. The last thing I did this week was to write my own weekly activity post and to make sure that all my group members were able to post theirs to GitHub without any problems.</p>
