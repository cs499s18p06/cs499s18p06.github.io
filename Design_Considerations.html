	<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
	<h3>April 28, 2018</h3>
	<p>During the last several weeks, the game has gone through several transitions. The most important being that the ghost scene doesn’t work on the Android device tested, but the menu scene does. We were never able to figure out why this was, but in order to qualify for a ‘minimally viable product’ we added tombstones to the menu scene. They respond to audio input the same way the ones in the game do.</p>
	<p>We tried to fix the ghost scene loading issue by changing the way the scene loads after hovering over the menu play button. While it didn’t work, we kept the changes, but the side effect is that the menu play button isn’t as quick as it used to be.</p>
	<h3>March 23rd, 2018</h3>
	<p>After a meeting with our customer, we pitched the shooting mechanism and went for a different approach. The idea was to have objects in the game interact with the microphone. An example would be when the player talks, the tombstones and trees will move accordingly to the frequency of the voice. We also have cut down on some features, like multiple scene changes, and focused on getting a working demo to operate.</p>
	<h3>March 2nd, 2018</h3>
	<p>On the topic of on rails shooter. We singled down the idea for more of a horror theme. We wanted the player to traverse through multiple scenes that included cemeteries, haunted houses, etc. We also decided on creating a design mechanism that when the player claps, the gun animation shoots.</p>
	<h3>Feburary 16th, 2018</h3>
	<p>Next meeting we discussed a few more ideas. Pivoting from the “Tempest” idea, we are working on an “on rails” shooter concept. This is inspired by the “buzz lightyear space ranger spin” ride at Walt Disney World. This game would you through an environment that would change based on what the hardware can hear. This could include enemies movements changing with pitch, interactions based on the beat of the music, certain elements occuring with certain sounds (excessive bass, LOUD NOISES, etc)</p>
	<h3>Feburary 9th, 2018</h3>
	<p>First idea was creating a simple arcade based design. Ideas were derived from mimicking basic 2D arcade platform game and using sonic user handling. One of the more talked about concepts was the old Atari “Tempest” games. We discussed in order to create a more virtual reality experience we will implement a larger frame of the 2D model and allow the user to look around with the headset.</p>
