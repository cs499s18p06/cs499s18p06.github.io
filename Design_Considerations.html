	<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
	<h3>Feburary 9th, 2018</h3>
	<p>First idea was creating a simple arcade based design. Ideas were derived from mimicking basic 2D arcade platform game and using sonic user handling. One of the more talked about concepts was the old Atari “Tempest” games. We discussed in order to create a more virtual reality experience we will implement a larger frame of the 2D model and allow the user to look around with the headset.</p>
	<h3>Feburary 16th, 2018</h3>
	<p>Next meeting we discussed a few more ideas. Pivoting from the “Tempest” idea, we are working on an “on rails” shooter concept. This is inspired by the “buzz lightyear space ranger spin” ride at Walt Disney World. This game would you through an environment that would change based on what the hardware can hear. This could include enemies movements changing with pitch, interactions based on the beat of the music, certain elements occuring with certain sounds (excessive bass, LOUD NOISES, etc)</p>
