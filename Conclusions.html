	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<p>In this project we learned various skills that will greatly benefit us in future career opportunities. Our team learned how to pruriently use software’s like Unity3D and Blender, as well as learning how to program with C# and the interactions between C# scripts with Unity3D. We learned how to create 3D environments, effectively using google cardboard API, Fast Fourier Transformation, and many other game functionalities such as shooting mechanics, UI development, and character movement. Most importantly we learned how to work as a team to deliver a final product to our customer. </p>
	<p> Our customer was generally pleased with the project, but there has been some issues. Due to team member responsibilities changing rapidly near the end of the design process, it put each person’s responsibility on the line make up for lack of others work. However, the minimum requirements to the project was completed but the final project has some implications. The Fast Fourier Transformation caused a lot of problems, as well as our main game scene crashing before loading.</p>
	<p>These are minor problems and if future teams work on this project these are easy fixes. All in all, it was a successful project. </p>
