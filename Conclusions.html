	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<p>In this project, we learned various skills that will greatly benefit our future career opportunities. Our team learned how to use software like Unity3D and Blender, as well as learned how to program with C# and manage the interactions between C# scripts and Unity3D. We learned how to create 3D environments and effectively use Google Cardboard API, Fast Fourier Transformation, and many other game functionalities such as shooting mechanics, UI development, and character movement. Most importantly we learned how to work as a team to deliver a final product to our customer.</p>
	<p>Our customer was generally pleased with the project, but there were some issues. Due to team member responsibilities changing rapidly near the end of the design process, each person was responsible to pick up the slack beyond their initial responsibilities. However, the minimum requirements of the project were completed, but the final project has some errors. The Fast Fourier Transformation caused a lot of problems, as well as our main game scene crashing before loading. We were not able to fix these issues and hope that if this project continues that the next group will be able to repair them. Overall, we are content in the work we did and the resulting product.</p>
