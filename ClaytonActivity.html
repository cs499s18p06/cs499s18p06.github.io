	<h3>Week 1: February 9, 2018</h3>
	<p>After our meeting with our customer we prioritized on a few things. For me, I downloaded Unity3D and started familizaring myself with the program itself. We want our program to perform on Android and iOS devices. Unfortunetly for me, I have a windows laptop and an iOS phone. When researching on how to export to an iOS device, every tutorial required a Mac computer. At the moment, it appears that I will not be able to test much design. However, during our meeting, Mr. Henz emphasized user experience, so I've decided to take on that task. From there, I started researching more into user interface by creating some basic start and pause menus. I've downloaded an assest that helps create more aesthetically pleasing visuals for text fonts and will be trying to incorprate more of that when we further get into our game development. </p>
	<p>Some other things I've worked on is helping create our team logo. I went on photoshop and made a handful of different style of logos. The following meeting I showed the designs to the team and we voted on which logo we liked best. The logo on the website is the design that we agreed upon.</p>
	<p> Lastly, I helped contribute ideas for our game design and created steps for how to prioritize the project. I wrote out the content for the requirment page and helped Caitlin set up the guide on how to access the Github for the remaining team members.</p>
