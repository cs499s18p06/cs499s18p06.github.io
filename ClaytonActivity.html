	<h3>Week 2: February 18, 2018</h3>
	<p>During this week I helped implement a few more designs and ideas for the team. For requirement section 2.3, I implemented the calendar and added a calendar section to the website. In order to complete this, I used our group’s Gmail account and embedded the calendar section into our website. We found this to be the most efficient use of a calendar because anybody on the team can update the calendar on any device that can access Gmail. Gmail also has a great built in UI experience so adding information to the calendar is easy and efficient. </p>
<p>For other parts of the website, I’ve included more information for the requirements page and the design consideration page.</p>
<p>For the project itself, I started getting a basic user interface being developed. I created a basic start menu that had a play, options, and quit button. When the cursor hovers over a button, the button becomes highlighted. With this, the user can go back and forth from the options menu to the main menu. The user can quit or the user can access the game.</p>
<p>I also developed a pause menu, same functionality as the start menu, but when the user selects the ESC key, the game is paused and the user is given access to the pause menu and the same types of functionality as the start menu. </p>
<p>However, implementing the two scenes together have been giving me some trouble. I believe this is an issue through Unity3D’s hierarchy system, and that this issue can be easily resolved with a little more research and troubleshooting. Once I can figure out how to go from screen to screen, I will start implementing VR user experience. </p>
<p>Lastly, I helped with the team decision making ideas on what game to create.</p>
	<h3>Week 1: February 9, 2018</h3>
	<p>After our meeting with our customer we prioritized on a few things. For me, I downloaded Unity3D and started familizaring myself with the program itself. We want our program to perform on Android and iOS devices. Unfortunetly for me, I have a windows laptop and an iOS phone. When researching on how to export to an iOS device, every tutorial required a Mac computer. At the moment, it appears that I will not be able to test much design. However, during our meeting, Mr. Henz emphasized user experience, so I've decided to take on that task. From there, I started researching more into user interface by creating some basic start and pause menus. I've downloaded an assest that helps create more aesthetically pleasing visuals for text fonts and will be trying to incorprate more of that when we further get into our game development. </p>
	<p>Some other things I've worked on is helping create our team logo. I went on photoshop and made a handful of different style of logos. The following meeting I showed the designs to the team and we voted on which logo we liked best. The logo on the website is the design that we agreed upon.</p>
	<p> Lastly, I helped contribute ideas for our game design and created steps for how to prioritize the project. I wrote out the content for the requirment page and helped Caitlin set up the guide on how to access the Github for the remaining team members.</p>
