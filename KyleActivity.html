	<h3>Week 8: April 1, 2018</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Week 7: March 25, 2018</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Weeks 5/6: March 18, 2018</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Week 4: March 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>As stated in the previous week's update stated, I spent the week working on the camera movement of the player as they move through the game environment. At first I tried using built in animations and other methods of movement within Unity 3D itself. With those methods not working, I discovered a wonderful asset called Camera Path Creator.</p>
	<p>This plugin for Unity allows me to set the exact course for the camera to follow, using waypoints set where there camera should go. With these waypoints, it's easy for me to change how the camera moves, should another team member change the layout of the level. And with timing controls as well, this assures us that the camera the user operates will be exactly where we want it to be. </p>
	<h3>Week 3: Feburary 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>With the various parts of the application working on mobile device, I set to work on the actual mechanics of the game, rather than just getting a program up and running. At the moment, I am working on getting the camera to move with with the "cart" along the "track" for the experience. This is somewhat tougher than I originally thought, as the Cardboard plug-in uses a different camera than normal Unity, to allow the stereo 3D effect for virtual reality. </p>
	<p>Additionally, I've been working on getting the shooting mechanic working for the game. As this is an "On Rails Shooter", it is a core component of the gameplay.  One important thing for me in developing this is that it can be set up to shoot with the "clapping" coming from the microphone.</p>
	<h3>Week 2: Feburary 18, 2018</h3>
	<p> This week, I spent some time trying to get my piece of the "hello world" program up and running. I've starting using the phone app Unity Remote 5, which should allow me to put my working Unity Project onto my phone. I was not able to get it to work, but during our meeting this week, I was able to get it to work on Kelvin's phone. This shows me that with some tweeking, that it can work. This is how I believe I will be doing my phone testing from now on. </p>
	<h3>Week 1: February 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>After our first meeting, I went to work on getting a 'Hello World' type program up and running. I have my own headset that works for my Android phone. I began working on getting Unity 3D up and running. I had built and example scene and used the "Google VR SDK for Unity", Version 0.6 to get the screen working properly. This scene included an example of UI selection "dot" in the middle of the screen, which is how many VR apps work for interaction.</p>
	<p>It was at this point I started having issues. Unity would not export the .apk (the Android app executable) out of Unity, claiming to have issues with the path to the Android Developer Kit. I uninstalled and re-installed the latest Unity, reinstalled the latest version of both the Android Developer Kit and the Java Developer Kit, yet the program did not cooperate. </p>
	<p>Unfourtunatly, at this point I am stuck. I am currently trying to fix this. I've had mulitiple friends that have encountered the same issue, and am consulting them for some help debugging. </p>
